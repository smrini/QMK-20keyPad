You can choose the switches and Keycaps that suit you
I provided the 3D files, as .stl and .3mf... you can print it if you have a 3D-Printer, or order it from an online supplier such as PCB Way...

Attention:   
    You can flash the same firmware directly without the need to build it in VScode AS LONG AS YOU ARE USING THE SAME SCHEMATIC AND THE SAME CONTROLLER.
    IF YOU ARE USING a different microcontroller than rp2040zero, you must modify the Pin Outs in the info.json file.
    You can still modify the layers design if you have experience with QMK. to suit your needs.
