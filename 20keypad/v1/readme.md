### Attention:

	You can compile and use the code as it is as long as you are using the same microcontroller and the same pins used in the schematic.
 	just download the files, open QMK MSYS and use this command: qmk flash -kb C:/thePath/to/theDownloaded/file/20KeyPad -km smrini.
  	You can modify the code and layers to whatever it suits you.


   	if you desided to use a different pins, you mast change the PinOuts on the info.json file.
    if you desided to use a different MicroController, you mast change some related information on the info.json file.
    
### Flashing example for this keyboard:

    qmk flash -kb handwired/20keypad/v1 -km default


## Bootloader

Getting into bootloader:

* **Physical reset button**: there are 2 buttons on the back of the PCB - press and hold the Boot button, don't leave it yet, press the reset button one time, after you leave it, remove your hand from the boot button.
* **Keycode in layout**: Press and hold the 3rd key from left on the top row then press the last key on the same row. The LED will blink 3 times, then hold in red, till the flash is complete
